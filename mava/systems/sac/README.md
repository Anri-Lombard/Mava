# Soft Actor Critic
todo: links

We provide 3 implementations of multi-agent SAC.
* ff-ISAC: feed forward independant SAC
* ff-MASAC: feed forward multi-agent SAC
* ff-HASAC: recurrent independant SAC

Where independant SAC uses independant learners and multi-agent SAC uses a CTDE style of training with a centralized critic and HASAC uses heterogenous style, sequential updates.

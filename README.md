## Welcome to Mava! ü¶Å

[**Installation**](#installation-)
| [**Quickstart**](#quickstart-)

Mava is first and foremost a tool for quickly iterating on multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) ideas. Mava provides useful implementations of MARL algorithms that in JAX allowing for easy parallelisation across devices with JAX's `pmap`. Originating in the Research Team at [InstaDeep](https://www.instadeep.com/), Mava is now developed jointly with the open-source community. ‚ÄúMava‚Äù means experience, or wisdom, in Xhosa - one of South Africa‚Äôs eleven official languages.

To join us in these efforts, please feel free to reach out, raise issues or read our [contribution guidelines](#contributing-) (or just star üåü to stay up to date with the latest developments)!

<hr>

üëã **UPDATE - 11/8/2023**: This is out first release of an end-to-end JAX version on Mava. Henceforth we will only be supporting JAX-based environments and systems with native support for the [Jumanji][jumanji] environment API. The reason for this change is to have a lightweight and easy-to-use end-to-end JAX based research tool. We are currently following a similar design philosophy to [CleanRL][cleanrl] and [PureJaxRL][purejaxrl] where we allow for code duplication to enable readability. All algorithmic logic can be found in the file implementing a particular algorithm. If you would still like to use our deprecated TF2-based systems please install [`v0.1.3`](https://github.com/instadeepai/Mava/releases/tag/0.1.3) of Mava (e.g. `pip install id-mava==0.1.3`).

### Overview ü¶ú

- ü•ë **Implementations of MARL algorithms**: Implementations of multi-agent PPO systems that follow both the Centralised Training with Decentralised Execution (CTDE) and Decentralised Training with Decentralised Execution (DTDE) MARL paradigms. There are
- üç¨ **Environment Wrappers**: Example wrapper for mapping a Jumanji environment to an environment usable by Mava. At the moment we only support [Robotic Warehouse][jumanji_rware] but plan to support more environments soon.
- üéì **Educational Material**:[user guides][quickstart] to facilitate Mava's adoption and highlight the added value of JAX-based MARL.

## Installation üé¨

At the moment Mava is not meant to be installed as a library, but rather to be used as a research tool.

You can use Mava by cloning the repo and pip installing as follows:

```bash
pip install -e .
```

We have tested `mava` on Python 3.9. Note that because the installation of JAX differs depending on your hardware accelerator,
we advise users to explicitly install the correct JAX version (see the [official installation guide](https://github.com/google/jax#installation)). For more in-depth instalations guides including Docker builds and virtual environments, please see our [detailed installation guide](DETAILED_INSTALL.md).

## Quickstart ‚ö°

We have a [Quickstart notebook][quickstart] that can be used to quickly create and train your first Multi-Agent System. For more on Mava's implementation details, please visit our [documentation].

## Contributing ü§ù

Please read our [contributing docs](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for details on how to submit pull requests, our Contributor License Agreement and community guidelines.

## Performance and Speed
It should be noted that in all cases here Mava is trained using a single 6GB Nivida 3060 laptop GPU.

In order to show the utility of end-to-end JAX-based MARL systems and JAX-based environments we compare the speed and performance of Mava against EPyMARL on a simple Robotic Warehouse task with 4 agents.

Furthermore, we illustrate the speed of JAX-based MARL by illustrating the system steps per second as the number of parallel environments are increased

Here, also note the system performance on a larger set of Robotic Warehouse environments:
